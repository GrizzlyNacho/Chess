The game of Chess as written by Nathan Lutz

To launch the game simply launch index.html in the bin directory or launch the swf directly. 

Design decisions:
 - Flash was used simply because of prior experience in flash
 - Model View Controller architecture as it provides isolation from the game state and the view of the game state. This could allow for AI implementation later on.

Note that the 'bin' directory is included in the repository so that anyone can test the various states of the game just by launching index.html of a given version checkout.
